# HSA microbenchmarks

This repository contains a set of microbenchmarks for determining the hardware characteristics of HSA devices.

Details for Kaveri (AMD A10-7850K) can be found via a blog post at ...

## Caches
This folder contains code and data (for AMD A10-7850K) for determining the cache capacity, cache associativity, cache miss latencies, etc. Additionally, this same code can be used to determine the TLB size/associativity/miss latency/etc.
